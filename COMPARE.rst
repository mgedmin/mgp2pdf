Problem statement
=================

I need a tool to compare two PDF files to catch regressions in mgp2pdf.

- I know the PDFs have the same number of pages (well, they're supposed to; if
  they don't, the tool needs to report that as a difference).
- I care about the visual layout, not just textual contents.  Perceptual diff:
  good, piping pdftotext to GNU diff: bad.
- I want automation: the tool should be able to compare two sets of PDFs
  and tell me if they're identical, and if not, produce a report with the
  differences between each pair of files.

My options are:

- Find an existing tool.
- Write a new tool.

I actually once wrote such a tool for an internal project.  I can extract and
open-source it.  I just need a name.  This means I have to survey existing
tools to avoid name clashes.  And hey, maybe one of the existing tools will
turn out to do what I want and I can save effort!

    - Nice idea in one answer: compare PDF content directly, ignoring irrelevant
      changes ::

        diff --brief -I xap: -I xapMM: -I /CreationDate -I /BaseFont -I /ID --binary --text

- apt-cache search compare pdf

    - comparepdf - command line tool for comparing two PDF files
    - diffpdf - compare two PDF files textually or visually

- GitHub search for "pdf diff" or "pdf compare"

`compare.py <https://github.com/mgedmin/mgp2pdf/blob/master/compare.py>`_
in this very repository:

- Can compare an .mgp with a .pdf, not just two PDFs.
- Renders the pages to images, makes them translucent, overlays them for manual
  visual comparison.
- Can be used interactively.
- Can produe a "report" (set of PNG files with translucent original pages
  overlaid on top of each other) in non-interactive mode.
- Not automated: doesn't tell if the two presentations are identical.
- Written in Python, uses Pillow and/or Pygame.
- Relies on external tools: mgp, pdftoppm, ImageMagick.

**compare-reportgen-output** from that internal project I mentioned:

- Can compare two sets of PDFs.
- Renders the pages to images, compares them pixel-by-pixel.
- Automated.
- Produes a report with differing pages shown next to each other and a third
  page with the differences highlighted.
- Some work needs to be done to make it generic.
- Written in Python.
- Relies on external tools: ImageMagick.
